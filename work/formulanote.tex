    In first-year claculus, we define intervals such as $(u, v)$ and $(u, \infty a, \phi)$. Such an interval
    is a \emph{neighborhood} of $a$ if $a$ is in the interval. Students should realize that $\infty$ is 
    only a symbol, not a number. 
    This is important since we soon introduce concepts such $\lim_{x \ to \infty} f(x)$
    $f'(x)$
    When we introduce the derivate 
    \[
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
    \]
    \[
        \left(\frac{1 + x}{2 + y^{e\lg\theta}}\right)^{2}
    \]
    \[
        \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = 2  
    \]
    we assume that the function is defined and continuous in a neighborhood of $a$.
