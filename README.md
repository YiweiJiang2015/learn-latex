# Learn latex

Overleaf provides a quick tour (~30 mins) to learn Latex. However, when I have day-to-day problems with the typeset more often, I found it annoying that I have to google a lot and read tons of uesless information in Stackoverflow. I start to ponder what is going wrong with my latex skill? It is just a markup language!!

One day, when I look up a French word in a hardcopy dictionary, I realize that my mindset needs a small index table
storing the map of latex knowledge to help me efficiently locate where I can solve my problem. The best approach to build such a map is to re-learn it in a more strucutured program, i.e. a book (or video courses if you like). 

I choose _Pratical Latex_ as my prime reference as it is light-weight compared to its giant counterpart _More Math into Latex_, both of which are written by George Gr√§tzer. Great books!
